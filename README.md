1) Machine learning classification system for evaluating recessionary economic states with X matrix as FRED time series economic indicators and y vector as NBER recessionary periods.  Method optimizes theta parameters by maximizing/(minimizing) average positive/(negative) Euclidean distances to a hyperplane.

2) Optimization of rebalanced portfolio weights to the Russell Global Index under sector, capitalization, transaction cost, and tax lot constraints.
